# NeweggScraperChsbr

Hello! Welcome to my Newegg Scraper Gem! This is a project for school, but I think it's quite usefull if you're trying to search Newegg for CPU prices, or CPU's in general.
There are a few things that won't work, more or less the computer will ignore any garbage text you put in on some of the yes or no questions.
You shouldn't be able to break the program with any weird numbers when prompted, but if you can please let me know.

## Usage

This program is intended to be used by someone who is looking to buy a computer. This program will get some data from Newegg.com and then it will parse it.
The program will display that data nicely to the user.
The program will then make the user choose one or some of the CPU's listed, and then display more information about the CPU(s) chosen.
